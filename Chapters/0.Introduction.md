# Introduction

Modern software relies heavily on open source components that are developed
collaboratively in a distributed setting, and that are assembled to create
complex systems that evolve at a fast pace.

This has strengthened the need to precisely track, ensure availability, and
guarantee integrity of the components that go into a given system for a variety
of stakeholders. Academia needs to ensure that research results are
reproducible, industry needs to improve the traceability of the software supply
chain, developer communities need tools to cope with the increasing complexity.

A key building block for addressing this issue is a system of *intrinsic*
identifiers that allows to precisely pinpoint the exact version of any software
artefact, at all levels of granularity, *without relying* on any central registry
or naming authority.

With this specification, the SWHID working group makes such a system of
intrinsic identifiers, originally developed for the Software Heritage
universal source code archive, available to all stakeholder.

For the sake of clarity, we will use examples drawn directly from the Software
Heritage archive, but notice that systems for persistent archival of software
artefacts, as well as resolution of SWHIDs are out of the scope of this
specification, and the SWHID specification does not require in any way the
use of Software Heritage.
