# Introduction

Modern software relies heavily on open source components that are developed
collaboratively in a distributed setting, and that are assembled to create
complex systems that evolve at a fast pace.

This has strengthened the need to precisely track, ensure availability, and
guarantee integrity of the components that go into a given system for a variety
of stakeholders. Academia needs to ensure that research results are
reproducible, industry needs to improve the traceability of the software supply
chain, and developer communities need tools to cope with the increasing complexity.

A key building block for addressing this issue is a system of intrinsic
identifiers that allows users to precisely pinpoint the exact version of any software
artifact, at all levels of granularity, without relying on any central registry
or naming authority.

With this specification, the SWHID working group makes such a system of
intrinsic identifiers, originally developed for the Software Heritage
universal source code archive [1], available to all stakeholders.

For the sake of clarity, examples have been drawn directly from the Software
Heritage archive; however, it is important to note that systems for the persistent archival of software
artifacts, as well as resolution of SWHIDs, are outside the scope of this
specification, which does not require the
use of Software Heritage.
