# 1 Scope

This SoftWare Hash IDentifier (SWHID) specification
defines a standard data format for referencing digital artifacts that
match the data model of modern distributed version control systems.

This includes the typical tree-like structure of a filesystem hierarchy,
but also special nodes to track revisions and releases, as well as the
full status of a version control system, with all its development
branches.

A key property of SWHIDs is that they can be computed using cryptographically
strong functions directly from the digital objects they refer to, by anyone that
has access to a copy of those objects. This enables decentralised and independent
verification of integrity, without relying on a registry or a central authority.

The computation of the SWHID identifiers is based on Merkle Acyclic Directed
Graphs, a natural generalization of Merkle trees.

The resolution of SWHIDs, that is, the process of obtaining a copy of a digital
artifact corresponding to a given SWHID, is out of the scope of this specification.
