## A.1 Current and Previous Versions

This edition has the version number 0.3.0 as part of its title.
Although this is the first edition of the SWHID Specification as a Publicly Available Standard,
earlier editions of the specification were published
by the Software Heritage.
Differences between this edition and earlier ones
are reported in the text; see also [[1]](B.Bibliography.md).

## A.2 Obsolete features

Over the life of a standard,
some older approaches can become obsolete
and are dropped from subsequent editions,
possibly with a replacement approach being provided.
Such action involves *deprecating* those outdated features.
This edition identifies all currently deprecated features.
