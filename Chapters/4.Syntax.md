# 4 Syntax

A SWHID consists of two separate parts, a mandatory *core identifier* that can
identify any software artifact (or "object"), and an optional list of
*qualifiers* that allows to specify the context where the object is meant to be
seen and point to a subpart of the object itself.

Syntactically, SWHIDs are generated by the `<identifier>` entry point in
the following grammar:

``` {.bnf}
<identifier> ::= <core_identifier> [ <qualifiers> ] ;

<core_identifier> ::= "swh" ":" <scheme_version> ":" <object_type> ":" <object_id> ;
<scheme_version> ::= "1" ;
<object_type> ::=
    "snp"  (* snapshot *)
  | "rel"  (* release *)
  | "rev"  (* revision *)
  | "dir"  (* directory *)
  | "cnt"  (* content *)
  ;
<object_id> ::= 40 * <hex_digit> ;  (* intrinsic object id, as hex-encoded SHA1 *)
<dec_digit> ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
<hex_digit> ::= <dec_digit> | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" ;

<qualifiers> := ";" <qualifier> [ <qualifiers> ] ;
<qualifier> ::=
    <context_qualifier>
  | <fragment_qualifier>
  ;
<context_qualifier> ::=
    <origin_ctxt>
  | <visit_ctxt>
  | <anchor_ctxt>
  | <path_ctxt>
  ;
<origin_ctxt> ::= "origin" "=" <url_escaped> ;
<visit_ctxt> ::= "visit" "=" <identifier_core> ;
<anchor_ctxt> ::= "anchor" "=" <identifier_core> ;
<path_ctxt> ::= "path" "=" <path_absolute_escaped> ;
<fragment_qualifier> ::= 
    "lines" "=" <number> ["-" <number>] 
  |	"bofs" "="  <number> ["-" <number>] ;
<number> ::= <dec_digit> + ;
<url_escaped> ::= (* RFC 3987 IRI *)
<path_absolute_escaped> ::= (* RFC 3987 absolute path *)
```

Where:

-   `<path_absolute_escaped>` is an `<ipath-absolute>` from [RFC
    3987](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987), and
-   `<url_escaped>` is a [RFC 3987](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987)
    IRI

in either case all occurrences of `;` (and `%`, as required by the RFC)
have been percent-encoded (as `%3B` and `%25` respectively). Other
characters *can* be percent-encoded, e.g., to improve readability and/or
embeddability of SWHID in other contexts.
