ISO and IEC maintain terminological databases for use in standardization at the following addresses: ISO Online browsing platform: available at https://www.iso.org/obp IEC Electropedia: available at http://www.electropedia.org/ 3.1 branch In the context of version control systems, a branch is a parallel line of development that stems from the main line (commonly known as the \"main\" or \"master\" branch). It allows developers to isolate their work for a particular feature or bug fix without affecting the main line of development. Once the work is complete and tested, it can be merged back into the main branch. 3.2 git Git is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It allows teams of programmers to work on the same code base without overwriting each other's changes. Git is known for its speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Each Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and version tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. 3.3 hierarchical file system A hierarchical file system is a method of organizing and managing files in a computer where data is stored hierarchically (in a structure often visualized as a tree). It uses directories (or 'folders') to organize files into a tree structure. Each directory can contain more files and directories, thus forming a hierarchical structure. 3.4 intrinsic identifier An identifier that can be computed directly from the object that it identifies, without needing a registry. Typical examples are cryptographically strong hashes. 3.5 repository In the context of version control systems, a repository is a storage location for software development artifacts including but not limited to source code, build scripts, documentation, etc. It often includes metadata about the stored items, such as version number, author, date of the last modification, etc. Repositories can be local or remote and are managed by version control systems like Git. 3.6 SHA1 SHA-1 (short for \"Secure Hash Algorithm 1\", also stylized as \" SHA1 \") is a hash function that takes as input a sequence of bytes and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value. The returned value is called SHA1 checksum , or simply SHA1 when there is no risk of ambiguity between the function and the returned value. A detailed description of how to compute SHA1 is available in RFC-3174. In the wake of the Shattered attack of 2017 (see paper: Stevens2017Shattered ), it is now possible to produce collision-prone files that are different but return the same SHA1 checksums. It is however possible to detect, during SHA1 computation, such SHA1-colliding files using counter-cryptanalysis (see paper: Stevens2013Counter ). As collision-prone files are problematic from the point of view of unequivocal identification and integrity verification, the SWHID standard takes measures to avoid that such files are referenced using only SHA1 checksums. For the purpose of this specification document, the SHA1 function is therefore considered to be a partial function, that only returns a value when a Shattered-style collision is not detectable using the techniques described in Stevens2013Counter and the reference implementation of it available at https://github.com/cr-marcstevens/sha1collisiondetection (version stable-v1.0.3 , corresponding to Git commit ID 38096fc021ac5b8f8207c7e926f11feb6b5eb17c ). When such a collision is detected during SHA1 computation, no SHA1 can be obtained for the object in question and hence, depending on the context, a valid SWHID might not exist for it. Note that in most cases SHA1 in this specification are computed on objects after adding specific headers to them, making \"trivial\" collision-prone files still perfectly valid and hence referenceable using SWHIDs. 3.7 version control system A version control system (VCS), also known as source control or revision control, is a software tool that helps manage different versions of software development artifacts. It keeps track of all changes made to the code, allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase, and provides mechanisms for merging changes, reverting changes, and branching and merging of code.

The swh prefix makes it explicit that this is a SWHID identifier. 1 ( <scheme_version> ) is the current version of this identifier scheme . Future editions will use higher version numbers, possibly breaking backward compatibility. The third field is a tag that correspond to the type of object identified: cnt for contents . dir for directories , rev for revisions , rel for releases , snp for snapshots , The fourth and last field is the intrinsic identifier of the object. In this version of the specification, this is a hex-encoded (using lowercase ASCII characters) SHA1 computed on the content and relevant metadata of the object itself, as follows. 5.1 Contents A content is an uninterpreted byte sequence, typically, the content of a file. For this type of object the intrinsic identifier is the sha1_git hash of it, i.e. the SHA1 of the byte sequence obtained by juxtaposing the ASCII string \"blob\" (without quotes), an ASCII space, the length of the content as ASCII-encoded decimal digits, a NULL byte, and the actual content of the file. No metadata is used for this type of object (in particular, notice that there is no file name mentioned here). As an example, swh:1:cnt:94a9ed024d3859793618152ea559a168bbcbb5e2 is the SWHID computed from the full text of the GPL3 license 5.2 Directories Directories are data structures commonly used in hierarchical file systems to group together files and other directories, and to hold relevant metadata about them, in the form of directory entries. This version of the SWHID standard adopts the same convention as the popular git version control system, and only takes into account as metadata the name of the directory entries (as a sequence of arbitrary bytes, excluding ASCII '/' and the NULL byte) and a simplified representation of the access rights. The names of entries in a directory must be distinct from one another. In order to compute the intrinsic identifier of a directory, it is necessary to compute first the SWHID of each object listed in the directory. Then one proceeds to create a serialization of the directory as follows: sort the directory entries using the following algorithm for each entry pointing to a directory , append an ASCII '/' to its name sort all entries using the natural byte order of their (modified) name for each entry, with a given name (unmodified), add a sequence of bytes composed of the normalized access rights, encoded as a sequence of ASCII-encoded octal digits ('100644' for regular files, '100755' for executable files, '120000' for symbolic links, '40000' for directories), an ASCII space, the name as a raw string of bytes a NULL byte the intrinsic identifier of the content or directory , encoded as a sequence of 20 bytes The intrinsic identifier of the directory is the SHA1 of the byte sequence obtained by juxtaposing the ASCII string \"tree\" (without quotes), an ASCII space, the length of the previously obtained serialization as ASCII-encoded decimal digits, a NULL byte, and the previously obtained serialization. As an example, swh:1:dir:d198bc9d7a6bcf6db04f476d29314f157507d505 is the is the SWHID computed from a directory containing the source code of the darktable photography application as a given point in time of its development on May 4th 2017. 5.3 Revisions Software development within a specific project is essentially a time-indexed series of copies of a single \u201croot\u201d directory that contains the entire project source code. Software evolves when a developer modifies the content of one or more files in that directory and record their changes. Each recorded copy of the root directory is known as a \u201crevision\u201d. It points to a single fully-determined directory and is equipped with arbitrary metadata. Some of those are added manually by the developer (e.g., revision message), others are automatically synthesized (timestamps, parent revision(s), etc). The supported metadata is as follows: author (arbitrary byte sequence, mandatory): generally contains the name and email address of the author of the revision. author timestamp (decimal timestamp from the Unix epoch, mandatory): the date at which the revision was authored. author timezone offset (arbitrary byte sequence): UTC offset at which the revision was authored, usually an ASCII-encoded [+/-]HHMM specification. committer (arbitrary byte sequence, mandatory): generally contains the name and email address of the committer of the revision. committer timestamp (decimal timestamp from the Unix epoch, mandatory): the date at which the revision was committed. committer timezone offset (arbitrary byte sequence): UTC offset at which the revision was committed, usually an ASCII-encoded [+/-]HHMM specification. directory (mandatory): the root directory recorded by the revision parent revisions (ordered list of revisions): the immediately preceding revisions in the development timeline. Can be empty for an initial revision, and have multiple revisions when multiple branches of history are being merged. extra headers (ordered list of byte key/value pairs): arbitrary additional metadata attached to the revision. The key must not contain the ASCII bytes for the space or LF characters; commonly used keys are a string of non-whitespace printable ASCII characters, such as \"encoding\" (where the value is interpreted as the encoding of the message field) or \"gpgsig\" (where the value is interpreted as an OpenPGP signature of the metadata of the revision). message: the message describing the revision In order to compute the intrinsic identifier of a revision, it is necessary to first compute the intrinsic identifier of the root directory recorded by the revision, as well as the intrinsic identifier of all parent revisions (recursively). The serialization of the revision is a sequence of lines in the following order: the reference to the root directory: the ASCII string \"tree\" (4 bytes) an ASCII space the ASCII-encoded hexadecimal intrinsic identifier of the directory (40 ASCII bytes) a LF for each parent revision, in the order they've been provided, a reference to that revision: the ASCII string \"parent\" (6 bytes) an ASCII space the ASCII-encoded hexadecimal intrinsic identifier of the parent revision (40 ASCII bytes) a LF the author line: the ASCII string \"author\" (6 bytes) an ASCII space the string of bytes provided for the author name and email, with each LF replaced by LF followed by an ASCII space an ASCII space the ASCII-encoded decimal representation of the author timestamp an ASCII space the string of bytes provided for the author timezone offset, with each LF replaced by LF followed by an ASCII space a LF the committer line: the ASCII string \"committer\" (9 bytes) an ASCII space the string of bytes provided for the committer name and email, with each LF replaced by LF followed by an ASCII space an ASCII space the ASCII-encoded decimal representation of the committer timestamp an ASCII space the string of bytes provided for the committer timezone offset, with each LF replaced by LF followed by an ASCII space a LF the extra header lines; for each provided key/value pair, in the order they have been provided: the key an ASCII space the value, with each LF replaced by LF followed by an ASCII space a LF if the message is defined: an extra LF (the message is separated from the header with two LFs) the commit message as a raw string of bytes The intrinsic identifier of the revision is the SHA1 of the byte sequence obtained by juxtaposing the ASCII string \"commit\" (6 bytes), an ASCII space, the length of the previously obtained serialization as ASCII-encoded decimal digits, a NULL byte, and the previously obtained serialization. As an example, swh:1:rev:309cf2674ee7a0749978cf8265ab91a60aea0f7d is the SWHID computed from a commit in the development history of Darktable , dated 16 January 2017, that added undo/redo supports for masks. 5.4 Releases Some revisions get selected by developers as denoting important project milestones known as \u201creleases\u201d. Each release points to the last commit in project history corresponding to the release and carries metadata: release name and version, release message, cryptographic signatures, etc. If they're not attached to development history (e.g. if they've been imported from bare tarballs), releases can also point directly to a root directory instead of a full revision with metadata. The supported metadata is as follows: - name (arbitrary byte sequence, mandatory): a name identifying the release - author (arbitrary byte sequence): generally contains the name and email address of the author of the release. - author timestamp (decimal timestamp from the Unix epoch): the date at which the release was authored. - author timezone offset (arbitrary byte sequence): UTC offset at which the release was authored, usually an ASCII-encoded [+/-]HHMM specification. - target object (mandatory): a reference to another object, which can be either a revision, a directory or less commonly a content or another release - message: the message describing the release In order to compute the intrinsic identifier of a release, it is necessary to first compute the intrinsic identifier of the targeted object. The serialization of the release is a sequence of lines in the following order: the reference to the target object: the ASCII string \"object\" (6 bytes) an ASCII space the ASCII-encoded hexadecimal intrinsic identifier of the target object (40 ASCII bytes) a LF the ASCII string \"type\" (4 bytes) an ASCII space an ASCII string referencing the type of the target object ( \"commit\" for a revision, \"tree\" for a directory, \"tag\" for another release, \"blob\" for a content object) a LF the name of the release: the ASCII string \"tag\" (3 bytes) an ASCII space the string of bytes provided for the release name, with each LF replaced by LF followed by an ASCII space a LF if there is an author, the author line: the ASCII string \"tagger\" (6 bytes) an ASCII space the string of bytes provided for the author name and email, with each LF replaced by LF followed by an ASCII space an ASCII space the ASCII-encoded decimal representation of the author timestamp an ASCII space the string of bytes provided for the author timezone offset, with each LF replaced by LF followed by an ASCII space a LF if the message is defined: an extra LF (the message is separated from the header with two LFs) the commit message as a raw string of bytes The intrinsic identifier of the release is the SHA1 of the byte sequence obtained by juxtaposing the ASCII string \"tag\" (3 bytes), an ASCII space, the length of the previously obtained serialization as ASCII-encoded decimal digits, a NULL byte, and the previously obtained serialization. As an example, swh:1:rel:22ece559cc7cc2364edc5e5593d63ae8bd229f9f is the SWHID computed from the Darktable release 2.3.0 , dated 24 December 2016. 5.5 Snapshots Any kind of software origin offers multiple pointers to the \u201ccurrent\u201d state of a development project. In the case of VCS this is reflected by branches (e.g., master, development, but also so called feature branches dedicated to extending the software in a specific direction); in the case of package distributions by notions such as suites that correspond to different maturity levels of individual packages (e.g., stable, development, etc.). A \u201csnapshot\u201d of a given software origin records all entry points found there and where each of them was pointing at the time. For example, a snapshot object might track the commit where the master branch was pointing to at any given time, as well as the most recent release of a given package in the stable suite of a FOSS distribution. Practically, a snapshot is a list of named branches pointing at objects of any of the known types (content, directory, revision, release or snapshot). A branch can also be an alias to another (named) branch, for instance the default \"HEAD\" branch can point at another, more specific, \"refs/heads/main\" branch. To compute the intrinsic identifier of a snapshot, one must first compute the intrinsic identifier of all objects referenced by the snapshot. Then one proceeds to create a serialization of the snapshot as follows: sort the snapshot branches using the natural byte order of their name for each branch, with a given name , add a sequence of bytes composed of the type of the branch target: \"content\" , \"directory\" , \"revision\" , \"release\" or \"snapshot\" for each corresponding object type \"alias\" for branches referencing another branch; an ASCII space the branch name (as raw bytes) a NULL byte the length of the target identifier, as an ascii-encoded decimal number ( \"20\" for intrinsic identifiers, the length of the name of the target branch for branch aliases) an ASCII colon ( \":\" ) the identifier of the target object pointed at by the branch: for contents, directories, revisions, releases or snapshots: their intrinsic identifier as a string of 20 bytes for branch aliases, the name of the target branch (as a string of bytes) for dangling branches, the empty string Note that, akin to the serialization of directories, there is no separator between entries. Because of alias branches, target identifiers are of arbitrary length and are length-encoded to avoid ambiguity. The intrinsic identifier of the snapshot is the SHA1 of the byte sequence obtained by juxtaposing the ASCII string \"snapshot\" (8 bytes), an ASCII space, the length of the previously obtained serialization as ASCII-encoded decimal digits, a NULL byte, and the previously obtained serialization. As an example, swh:1:snp:c7c108084bc0bf3d81436bf980b46e98bd338453 is the SWHID computed from a snapshot of the entire Darktable Git repository as it was on 4 May 2017 on GitHub. Note on compatibility with Git SWHIDs for contents, directories, revisions, and releases are, at present, compatible with the way the current version of Git proceeds for computing identifiers for its objects. The <object_id> part of a SWHID for a content object is the Git blob identifier of any file with the same content; for a revision it is the Git commit identifier for the same revision, etc. This is not the case for snapshot identifiers, as Git does not have a corresponding object type.

The names of entries in a directory must be distinct from one another. In order to compute the intrinsic identifier of a directory, it is necessary to compute first the SWHID of each object listed in the directory. Then one proceeds to create a serialization of the directory as follows: sort the directory entries using the following algorithm for each entry pointing to a directory , append an ASCII '/' to its name sort all entries using the natural byte order of their (modified) name for each entry, with a given name (unmodified), add a sequence of bytes composed of the normalized access rights, encoded as a sequence of ASCII-encoded octal digits ('100644' for regular files, '100755' for executable files, '120000' for symbolic links, '40000' for directories), an ASCII space, the name as a raw string of bytes a NULL byte the intrinsic identifier of the content or directory , encoded as a sequence of 20 bytes The intrinsic identifier of the directory is the SHA1 of the byte sequence obtained by juxtaposing the ASCII string \"tree\" (without quotes), an ASCII space, the length of the previously obtained serialization as ASCII-encoded decimal digits, a NULL byte, and the previously obtained serialization.

The following context qualifiers are available: 6.1 Fragment qualifiers 6.1.1 Lines qualifier A \"line\" in the context of a file content refers to a sequence of characters that ends with a line break. This line can contain text, code, or any other form of data. In this specification, the line break is the ASCII LF character. The \"lines\" qualifier allows to designate a line range inside a content. The range can be a single line number, or a pair of line numbers separated by the ASCII - character.

Here is an example: swh:1:cnt:4d99d2d18326621ccdd70f5ea66c2e2ac236ad8b;origin=https://gitorious.org/ocamlp3l/ocamlp3l_cvs.git;visit=swh:1:snp:d7f1b9eb7ccb596c2622c4780febaa02549830f9;anchor=swh:1:rev:2db189928c94d62a3b4757b3eec68f0a4d4113f0;path=/Examples/SimpleFarm/simplefarm.ml;lines=9-15","title":"6.3 Recommendations"},{"location":"A.Conformance/","text":"Annex A Conformance (Informative) A.1 Current and Previous Versions This edition has the version number 1.0 as part of its title.
