# The SWHID Specification

The SWHID specification defines an open standard for content-based identifiers
of digital objects.

This standard defines the syntax, description and precise computation process
for a SWHID, which is intended to provide unique identification, guarantee
integrity and enable provenance tracking of digital objects that may have, and
be part of, a hierarchical structure.
